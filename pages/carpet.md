description: Everyone knows when you are doing anything to a house, you start with a basic thought, such as, "I want to fix the pee-stained carpet."  A couple of thousand dollars later and our kitchen and living room are close to done.

I truly had good intentions when I said, I wanted to replace just the carpet.  However, if you look at the path to replace the flooring it doesn't just stop with the floors.  We should probably paint so we are not ruining the new flooring as it goes down. Plus if I am being honest, the maroon and tan that our home has EVERYWHERE is so incredibly triggering to me (that's a trauma issue).  It's time for the paint colors to go!

Waylon had already sprayed our brick fireplace black to test out the new paint sprayer before using it on the front of our house.  We love the way the black looks on the brick.  Now it was time to cover up the maroon and tan.  Waylon decided he could spray the walls.  It went quickly, but it also filled our home with paint fumes.  Leaving my lungs in distress.  

>I am always balancing my medical symptoms with my stubborness to get things done.  However, breathing is a deal breaker.

I stopped him from spraying and we rolled the remaining wall.  The intense release of emotion I felt covering up the maroon and tan was wonderful!  I will put the paint colors below if you are curious.

SO... Off to Menards, I went. I was trying to purchase the cheapest flooring to just fix this carpet so our animals stop shredding it and trying to mark their territories.

I purchased this cheap, flooring that was on sale. It would get the living room done in under $400, and that way when we want to eventually put the money towards the flooring we can upgrade.  I loaded the flooring, and got it home.

There, a solution was made.  Until I had Waylon unload all the boxes into our living room and I started trying to lay down this "flooring".  I am convinced it is just fancy cardboard at this point.  The planks were made out of MDF and shredded as the boards went together.  It looked horrible on our floor and we only put one box down.  This was not a good sign.  We quickly realized why quality is so much more important than quantity.  Back to the drawing boards, we went. Or in my case, back to YouTube. 

!!! note "Lesson 1:"
    Do not be a cheap scape and figure out the final look you want ahead of time. 
 
We took a step back, I watched a ton of YouTube videos, which automatically makes me a professional in what I am tackling. I learned about the various types of floors and what underlayment is.  I did some research between the 3 big box stores we have in our area and I learned that HomeDepot was the place I was going with to get the LifeProof Flooring.  I like the way it looks and its features of being good for pets, and kids, and somewhat waterproof were lyrics to my ears.  The cost got me though.  Whew...not at all what I wanted to spend, but I am thankful we did it.  In the long run, I think this will make our home beautiful and it will get rid of the mismatched tile and bring the cabinets
